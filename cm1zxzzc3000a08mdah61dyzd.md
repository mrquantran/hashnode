Here are 10 popular platforms you can use to create a blog portfolio tailored for developers based on your needs:

1. **Hashnode**: Tailored specifically for developers, Hashnode allows custom domain mapping and offers personalization options for your blog, making it a great choice for building a professional portfolio. It also provides a built-in developer community to enhance reach and engagement【7†source】【8†source】.
    
2. **Substack**: Ideal for writing newsletters and blogs, Substack is known for its simplicity and audience engagement tools. You can use it to publish regular posts while building a following. However, customization might be limited compared to other platforms【7†source】.
    
3. [**DEV.to**](http://DEV.to): This platform focuses on community and sharing knowledge among developers. It offers a large, active audience and includes social media promotion features, but lacks customization options, and all blogs have a similar look【7†source】【8†source】.
    
4. **GitHub Pages**: If you're familiar with HTML, CSS, or static site generators like Jekyll, you can host a portfolio for free on GitHub Pages. This offers full control over the design and structure of your blog【8†source】.
    
5. **Hacker Noon**: Known for high-quality editorial content, Hacker Noon allows you to reach a large audience but limits customization. It's great for cross-posting articles and promoting developer content【8†source】.
    
6. **Medium**: With a huge audience and a sleek design, Medium is easy to use but doesn't allow much customization. You can't use your own domain unless you join their paid partner program【8†source】.
    
7. **WordPress**: A highly flexible option, WordPress allows complete customization, supports plugins, and has a variety of themes to match your style. It's perfect for developers who want more control over their blog's design and features.
    
8. **Ghost**: If you're looking for a platform that combines clean design with performance, Ghost is a great option. It’s open-source and offers more customization and flexibility than Medium【7†source】.
    
9. **Notion**: Notion is a collaborative workspace but can be transformed into a simple, elegant blog or portfolio with minimal effort. It's easy to use for documenting projects, showcasing work, and creating a portfolio.
    
10. **Jekyll** (Static Site Generator): Paired with GitHub Pages, Jekyll allows developers to build fully customized static websites without a database. This is perfect for those who want maximum control over their portfolio【7†source】【8†source】.
    

These platforms offer various levels of customization, community engagement, and ease of use. You can choose based on your technical skills and how much control you want over the design and functionality of your blog.
